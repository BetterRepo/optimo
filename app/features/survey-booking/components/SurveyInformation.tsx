      We want to let you know that we are in the process of updating all of our company vehicles with Better Earth logos, so it is possible that our technicians will show up to your property in a vehicle that does not have a Better Earth logo. However, all of our technicians will have Better Earth ID badges on them to present to you.
    </p>
    <p className="text-red-600 font-semibold mb-4">
      As a reminder, during the assessment our technician will be walking the property, getting photos of the electrical system as well as getting photos from the top of the roof which will go to our design and engineering team to further assess the conditions present at the home.

      Thank you for choosing Better Earth. Have an excellent day!
